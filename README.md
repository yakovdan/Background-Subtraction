# Background-Subtraction
Final Project of DSP course

The purpose of this project is to solve a background subtraction problem using Robust PCA. 
It is based on "Background Subtraction Based on Low-Rank and Structured Sparse Decomposition
Xin Liu, Guoying Zhao, Senior Member, IEEE, Jiawen Yao, and Chun Qi, Member, IEEE" 

It also has some improvements in the LSD part and elsewhere, by Guy Morag, my partner on this project.

1. run lsd_improvment
2. run computeRPCADecomposition
3. run precomputed_main
4. run compute_score

for details, see arguments in main functions.
